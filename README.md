<p id="description">Simple smart home project using OpenCV2</p>

By detecting faces and bodies I controlled my room lights and added a gesture (HAND OPENED OR CLOSED) to control the back LEDs

The XML files: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades 

<h2>In C++ exstension seetings </h2>

add the opencv2 include path
```
../Smart_Home/include
```

<h2>Notes</h2>

* change the Port 
* change the canny, Blur, and greyscale arguments if needed to match your camera
* In the control file change the Arduino pins and commands with respect to the source file
